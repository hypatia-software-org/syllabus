Unit 0 - Welcome to the Hypatia Python Coursework!
---

Welcome to the our self study guide! We really hope this is of
use to you as you make your way though Hypatia's Mentorship
program. This study guide uses the following format as you work
you way though the units and sub-units:

* A brief intro to get you on the right path.
* A list of exercises to complete (not every unit has these)
* A list of 'references' that you will need to read to complete any tasks or exercises for this unit

If at any time you get stuck or lost, contact your mentor! Do not be afraid to ask questions, the only foolish ones are those we wait too long to ask.

Also remember to make use of the #learning channel on Slack. This is a great place to ask for help if you would like more generic feedback from the group.
