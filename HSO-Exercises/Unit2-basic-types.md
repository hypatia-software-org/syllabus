Unit 2 - Exploring Python (Integers/Strings/Lists)
---

### **Exercises**

In a Python shell:

* Add, subtract, multiply, divide and exponentiate 9 and 3
* Concatenate "koala" and "bear" with a space in between them
* Put an integer list into a variable, add the second to the first and store it back into the first element
* Put a string list into a variable, concatenate the second to the first and store it back into the first element
* Append two new elements to the back of each list
* Remove the second and third element to create a new list

* Make a list with five elements, 'koalas', 'are', 'are', 'arr', 'cute'
* Extend the list with another list ['and', 'so', 'are', 'sloths']
* Append the string '!'
* Count the number of occurrences of the word 'sloths', 'koalas', and the word 'are'
* Remove the first element whose value is 'are'
* Now count the number of occurrences of the word 'sloths', 'koalas', and the word 'are'
* Pop the third element
* Create a string by joining all remaining elements and putting a space in between them

* Find the index of where the string 'sloths' occurs
* Create a new list with the third element, the two elements before the element 'sloths', and the element 'sloths'
* Reverse it and join them into a string with a space separator

* Create a list [10, 3, 1, 50, 10] and sort it

* Create a list of lists, one of strings and the other of strings.  Show the third elements in each.
