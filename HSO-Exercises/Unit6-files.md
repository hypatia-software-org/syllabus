### **Exercises**

In your `hypatia-exercises` repository:

* Create a file named `inputfile.txt` with a text editor. Edit the file to have the following contents:

inputfile.txt:

    This is line one
    This is line two
    This is line three
    This is line four
    You get the point, this is line five!
    Line six, pick up sticks

* Expand the `unit6.py` program that reads `inputfile.txt` and `print()`s it to the screen.
* Expand the `unit6.py` program to write the contents of the `inputfile.txt` to a new file named `outputfile.txt`.
