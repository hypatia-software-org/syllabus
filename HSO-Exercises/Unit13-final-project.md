Unit 13 - Final Project
----

Congratulations, you made it this far! The remainder of this course will take the form of a final project. You will work with your mentor to create a new open source project with an `MIT` or `GPL` type license (your choice). To help you with this process you can use this useful list to start your project:

* Pick your project! We recomend writing a web application in django! It can be anything you want, if you are having trouble coming up with something here are some ideas: A reminder program, game, photo gallery, etc.
* Create a new repository on GitHub.com. Be sure to add a `README.md` file as well as a `LICENSE` file
* Continue to meet with your mentor one hour a week as you work on this project. Be sure to come with questions prepared for when you get stuck.

Good luck and happy hacking!
