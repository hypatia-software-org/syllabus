Unit1 - VirtualBox (Windows/Mac/Linux)
---

To get started, first download the data image we will use:

* [Hypatia Software FreeBSD Virtual Data Image](http://cdn.hypatiasoftware.org/hso-dev-image.vdi.zip)

Uncompress it to a directory and remember where it's located.

Now, go to the [VirtualBox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) website and
select the appropriate binary from the list provided.  Download and run the VirtualBox program.

* Create a new virtual machine by hitting the 'New' button in the upper left hand corner
* Choose a name (e.g. 'Sandbox') and make sure to selec the 'Type' as `BSD`  and 'Version' as `FreeBSD (64-bit)`
* Select a memory size that your computer can handle (128MB?)
* Select "Use an existing virtual hard drive file" and when prompted, select the uncompressed Hypatia Software virtual data image.
* Hit the 'Create' button.
* There should be a new machine listed to the left with text indicating that it's 'Powered Off'.
* Highlight the new machine listed on the left and hit the 'Start' button at the top.

The virtual machine should start to boot up and you're ready to go!
