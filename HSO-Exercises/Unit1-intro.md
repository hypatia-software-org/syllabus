Unit 1 - Installing the development system
---

VirtualBox allows you to run a virtual machine no matter what your
host operating system is (Windows, Mac, Linux).  VirtualBox
will be used to run Hypatia Software's FreeBSD virtual machine
image so that there is a standard system to do development on.

First install VirtualBox.  This will be different depending
on which host operating system you use.
