Unit 1 - Command Line Interface (cli)
---

The command line provides a more advanced interface to interact
with the operating system.  Textual commands are entered in the "shell"
to issue various operations.

The main advantage to working in the "shell" is that it enables the
user (you) to have full control over the way commands are executed.
While there are graphical tools that allow you to do many of these
same functions, it is very important that you learn what is going
on behind the scenes. This way if a graphical program is not working
right you will know what is going on under the hood, and will most
likely be equipped to solve the problem.


While navigating your shell there are some basics commands that you
will need to know to get started (when you see DIRECTORY_NAME or
FILE_NAME be sure to replace this with the directory of your choice):

* `pwd` - Show the Present Working Directory that you are currently in (where you are)
* `ls` - List current files and directories in your current working
directory (what is here)
* `cd DIRECTORY_NANE` - Change Directory to the DIRECTORY_NAME you give (move around)
* `mkdir DIRECTORY_NAME` - Create a new directory with the name DIRECTORY_NAME
* `cat FILE_NAME` - Print a file to the screen

### **Exercises**

* list a directory
* show the current directory
* create a directory
* go into the newly created directory
* list the directory with hidden files
* print something out on the shell
